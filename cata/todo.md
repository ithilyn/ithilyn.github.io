    * DONE Honored: [Pendant of Elemental Balance](http://www.wowhead.com/item=62354)

  * **The Guardians of Hyjal**
    * DONE Revered: new arcanum (helm enchant).
    * Nothing else from them is valuable, so feel free to stop grinding that rep once you reach revered.
  * **The Ramkahen of Uldum**
    * DONE Honored: [Drystone Greaves](http://www.wowhead.com/item=62438), boots are a particularly rare item for us, so be sure to snag these when you can.

  * **the Dragonmaw Clan**
    * has but a single item available for us, at exalted, and it's only a necklace. 
    * They're definitely the last faction you'll want to work on.
