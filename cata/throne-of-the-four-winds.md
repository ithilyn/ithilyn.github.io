## Conclave of Wind
  * all Djinn must be killed within 1 minute of each other
  * bring down Rohash and Anshal evenly during recharge phase, then Nezir during full energy phase.
  * key is finding right balance of DPS for each group
  * The tank and tank healers for Anshal and Nezir will swap positions every other recharging phase to deal with the stacking [Wind Chill](http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=93123) debuff.
  * **Anshal** - Nature (Green)
    * requires tank, extra dps, slightly more healers
    * dps must split up and burn down Ravenous Creepers so [[http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=93121|Toxic Spores]] don't stack too much on everyone
    * Avoid [Soothing Winds](http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=86206) green circle on the ground, silences players, heals him and Creepers
  * **Rohash** - Wind (Red)
    * requires no tank, fewer dps (ranged preferred), fewer healers
    * [Tornado](http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=93142)
    * [Wind Blast](http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=93139)
      * He will start at a random direction and move clockwise for 10 seconds, blasting anyone in his line of sight. Everyone on the platform needs to move clockwise to avoid the blast or be knocked off and most likely killed.
  * **Nezir** - Frost (Blue)
    * requires a tank and healer(s?), no dps
    * tank faces him away for [[http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=93123|Permafrost]]
    * healers move out of any [[http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=93130|Ice Patches]], don't stand on pathways coming into the platform (so you don't cause Ice Patches to drop in the way of dps coming in for full energy phase)
    * damage will increase due to [[http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=93123|Wind Chill]]
  * Full Energy phase
    * Nezir: [[http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=86367|Sleet Storm]]
      * dps burn, healers deal with raid damage
    * Anshal: [[http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=93119|Zephyr]]
    * Rohash: [[http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=86481|Hurricane]]
    * **be sure to switch as needed at around 80 energy--at 90 energy the bridges disappear**
    * Entire Rohash group except a single healer switches to Nezir
      * healer staying at Rohash must live through [[http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=86481|Hurricane]] (use instants)
    * Entire Anshal group switches to Nezir
      * dps must have finished off any remaining Creepers, or [[http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=93119|Zephyr]] will heal them
    * Nezir tank and tank healer switches to Anshal
    * once done, dps move back to assignments, tank and tank healers remain at swapped positions
      * allows [[http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=93123|Wind Chill]] to fade from group that just had Nezir
  * Nezir Burn phase
    * should be at 50%
    * save Bloodlust/big dps cooldowns for now
    * must kill within a minute and before [[http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=93123|Wind Chill]] stacks too high

==== Al'Akir ====
  * http://www.icy-veins.com/al-akir-healer-strategy
  * Phase 1 (100-80%)
    * [[http://www.wowhead.com/spell=93257|Lightning Strike]]: stand in groups of 2s on the clovers. Spread healers equally in 1, 3, 5 spots to be able to heal everyone
    * [[http://www.wowhead.com/spell=87856|Squall Line]]s: 5sec to fully materialize. When tornados circle around the platform, find the gap between them and go through it to avoid getting grabbed by them. move forward/back, not left/right to dodge
    * [[http://www.wowhead.com/spell=93260|Ice Storm]]: avoid ice patch
    * [[http://www.wowhead.com/spell=87770|Wind Burst]]: ~ every 25sec. move closer to boss, deals dmg knocks everyone back.
    * [[http://www.wowhead.com/spell=87873|Static Shock]]: interrupts casters in mele, stay out
    * [[http://www.wowhead.com/spell=88427|Electrocute]]: hits tank if out of mele
    * **Strat**:
      * Move in for Wind Burst and position yourself accordingly for Squall Line while maintaining your designated location so that Lightning Strike does not do a lot of damage.
      * Heal raid members in your own group, as well as those groups assigned to you (on your left and right).
  * Phase 2 (80-25%)
    * [[http://www.wowhead.com/spell=87856|Squall Line]]s, [[http://www.wowhead.com/spell=87873|Static Shock]], and [[http://www.wowhead.com/spell=88427|Electrocute]] continue
    * [[http://www.wowhead.com/spell=93281|Acid Rain]]: stacking DoT, gets worse
    * Stormling adds every 25sec. Applies [[http://www.wowhead.com/spell=87904|Feedback]] to Al'Akir.
    * **Strat**:
      * 2 groups: ranged/healers, mele/tank
      * in terms of movement, your only concern is positioning yourself correctly for the gap in the Squall Line. 
      * Other than this, you must simply heal through the increasing raid damage dealt by Acid Rain and the damage the tank will be receiving from both Al'Akir's melee attacks and the damage done by Stormlings
  * Phase 3 (25-0%)
    * [[http://www.wowhead.com/spell=89107|Eye of the Storm]]: ground fall out, you fly
    * [[http://www.wowhead.com/spell=87770|Wind Burst]] is back
    * [[http://www.wowhead.com/spell=93298|Lightning Clouds]]: on randomly targeted player. move up/down
    * [[http://www.wowhead.com/spell=89668|Lightning Rod]]: on one player, damages all within 20yds. Move away (horizontally) if you get!
    * [[http://www.wowhead.com/spell=93291|Lightning]] on random players is unavoidable
    * don't get knocked out too far: [[http://www.wowhead.com/spell=89104|Relentless Storm]]: damages you and traps you for 6sec
    * **Strat**:
      * Start by having EVERYONE move UP, towards the altitude of the bosses head. 
      * Set a raid mark on someone to keep everyone at the same level.
      * Place Lightning Clouds intelligently
      * Stay fairly close to him, and move back in after Wind Burst
