#### Rom'ogg Bonecrusher
  * outrange his AoE ability [The Skullcracker](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=75543)
    * the chains trap everyone. You have to DPS through them in order to get out of range before the Skullcracker hits, because the AoE is an effective one-shot
  * H: adds
  * [Wounding Strike](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=75571)
  * [Quake](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=75272)

#### Corla, Herald of Twilight
  * [Evolution](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=75610)
  * [Aura of Acceleration](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=87376)
  * Fear w/30k shadow damage
  * Assign 2 DPS to hop in and out of the beams, to prevent those Twilight Zealots from transforming into Twilight Drakonids.
    * hop out when stack hits 70, back in when it clears
  * Wait for 1 Drakonid to transform at a time

#### Karsh Steelbender
  * cleaves, don't stand in front!
  * tank must drag through flows of molten metal in center of room to build 5-6 stacks of [Superheated Quicksilver Armor](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=75846). This makes him vulnerable, but then he does more damage, so not too much! Then re-drag through the middle when it wears off.
  * H: Have the tank dip him in the lavafall for 1-2 stacks, pull him out for 4-5 seconds, dip him in for 1-2 more stacks, rinse and repeat. The trick is to never let the debuff fall off or he spawns adds. He cleaves so stay behind him.

#### Beauty
  * berserks if Runty dies
  * [Berserker Charge](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=76030)s player furthest from her
  * [Flamebreak](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=76032): knocks back tank and dps
  * [Magma Spit](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=76031)
  * AoE fear
  * just suck it all up
  * clear trash outside to about fear aggro
  * H: lock the pups down with fear, root, hibernate

#### Ascendant Lord Obsidius
  * 2 adds: Shadow of Obsidius
    * put a healing debuff on their target
    * must be cc'd/kited by 2 dps
    * The Shadows can't be stunned, feared, or even damaged much, but they can be rooted, snared, and/or slowed
  * occasionally switches places with an add and drops aggro
    * tank picks up, dpsers switch
