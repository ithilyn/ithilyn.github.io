  * [http://www.wowhead.com/npc=53214#comments](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=53214#comments)
  * Turning in 20 marks unlocks Phase 2.
  * Phase 1 starts in Hyjal. You need 20 marks to proceed, it takes 3 days doing the dailies there.
  * Phase 2 involves getting 150 tokens. It takes an additional 11 days, doing four Fireland dailies and 3 dailies back in Hyjal, every day.
  * Then an escort quest opens up - which you apparently get to do daily. Now you get to do the 7 dailies from Phase 2, as well as 5 dailies + 2 escorts - a total of 14 dailies in Phase 2 and 3. Because you need an ADDITIONAL 300 marks to move to even see the vendor. This takes 12 days.
  * Now you have 3 NPCs visible, one being this guy. It takes 125 tokens to unlock EACH vendor, so 5 days. Per vendor.
  * To unlock the first vendor takes 31 days; to unlock all three takes 41 days.
