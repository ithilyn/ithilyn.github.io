title: King Arthas
---
  * /focus the LK
  * [Shadow resist aura](http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48943) unless Priest, then Devo.  Or Frost?
  * Beacon Drudge Ghoul tank (Hab), SS/Fol LK tank (Gekk)
  * Transitions: stand near the crack so you don't have to run so far



### Phase 1 (100% - 70%)
  * [Infest](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=70541)
    * Best countered with [Power Word: Shield](http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48066)
  * [Necrotic Plague](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=70337)
    * Watch the timers and call out when it is about to go out and then who it lands on. Once that person is in range of the adds you’ll want to cleanse it. You only have 5 seconds so be careful with long casts as it approaches.
    * **Dispel the plague at 4s regardless of whether the person with it is in the right place or not**
    * Jumps cause [Plague Siphon](http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=74074) to stack on the LK
  * [Shambling Horrors](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=70372)
      * [Shockwave](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=72149) cone in front, must be tanked facing away from raid
      * clear the path between the mob and the tank tanking it or you'll get hit
      * hunters or rogues should tranquilize it when it enrages
  * [Drudge Ghouls](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=70358)
  * We setup in a triangle fashion with Arthas/Tank/Melee/Drudge Ghouls in one corner, Casters/Ranged in another corner and Shambling Horrors/OT in the last corner. This way, no matter who gets Necrotic Plague, it is easily transferable to the Shambling Horrors by shifting a slight distance. If you are targeted with Necrotic Plague, make sure you stay behind the Shambling Horrors to avoid getting cleaved by their Shockwave. 
  * Cheat Sheet
    * Heal from melee on the LK
    * Keep beacon heals flowing between the tanks
    * Watch for spikes from LK’s stacks or from enraged horrors
    * Cleanse the plague the moment its target is closest to adds
    * Watch for the add tank to catch the plague from dying adds
    * Run to the add tank if you get the plague yourself
    * When the LK runs to the center, run to the outer edge of the platform
### Phase Transition #1
  * Spread out and regen mana.
  * Keep the OT up
  * When the LK casts [Quake](http://wowhead.com/spell=72262), run back in to the center
    * Don't run into a Raging Spirit's cone of silence
    * Don't run into an Ice Sphere and get knocked around
  * [Pain and Suffering](http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=72133)
  * [Raging Spirits](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=69200)
    * summoned on random people, run to the tank
    * they cast [Soul Shriek](http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=69242), which you can cleanse off others
  * [Summon Ice Spheres](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=69103)
    * cast [Ice Pulse](http://wowhead.com/spell=73776) and [Ice Burst](http://wowhead.com/spell=69108) (knockback)
    * assist dpsing if possible
  * Cheat Sheet
    * Pick an empty spot right up against the edge of the outer rim of the platform
    * Cleanse the plague off the add tank as the last add dies
    * Beacon/SS/FoLHoT the tank who will be catching most of the adds
    * Be ready for significant damage from stacks of the DoT
    * Boogie to the nearest tank if an add is spawned under you
    * Stay the heck away from the raging spirits’ silence
    * Watch for spheres and nuke ‘em only if you have downtime
    * Run back to the center when you see blue cracks, avoiding spheres and raging spirits

### Phase 2 (70% - 40%)
  * Absolute requirement #1: be as close to the center as possible when each newly summoned Val’Kyr swoops down. In practice, this means running to the center immediately as the phase starts. From then on, only leave the center to spread out for a defile when a Val’kyr is out or on cooldown.
  * [Infest](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=70541)
  * [Defile](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=72754)
  * [Summon Val'kyr](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=69037)
  * [Soul Reaper](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=69409)
  * Val’kyrs pickup your raid members and toss them off the platform, as such you want to maximize your distance by grouping up in the middle of the platform and by using stuns to increase your time to kill them. Defile on the other hand, grows depending on how many people are in it so you want to spread out as much as possible, the less people and faster you are in it, the smaller it will be.
  * Timers:
    * Val’kyrs first, Defile second (10s gap)
    * Val’kyr first, Defile second (2-5s gap)
    * Defile first, Val’kyr second (2-5s gap)
    * Val’kyr first, Defile second (10s gap)
    * Defile
  * Or:
    * Group then Spread
    * Group than Spread
    * Spread than Group
    * Group than Spread
    * Spread
  * [Remorseless Winter](http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=68981) cast at end of phase, move to edge as it's rebuilt
  * Cheat Sheet
    * Get in a few SoW procs off the LK while everyone is grouped up for an incoming Val’Kyr
    * Spread out a bit the moment the Val’Kyr picks someone up
    * Haul to the edge as the LK starts casting Defile, maybe pop Aura Mastery with shadow res
    * Move Beacon/SS around as the tanks taunt, be ready for cooldowns for Soul Reaper if needed
    * Go into overdrive if a healer gets picked up
    * Lather, rinse, and repeat for what seems like an eternity
    * Run to the edge for another transition at 40%, maybe popping Aura Mastery with frost res

### Phase Transition #2
  * Like Transition #1

### Phase 3 (40% - 10%)
  * There will be a lot of motion in this phase. Try to choose a place where you can be at a safe distance from people while healing hard. 
  * [Infest](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=70541)
  * [Defile](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=72754)
  * [Soul Reaper](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=69409)
    * Hits hard, tanks should switch off so they can use cooldowns on this
  * [Harvest Soul](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=68980)
    * Heal hard the moment it shows up on the radar. You only have a couple of GCDs before most raiders will die so do not hesitate.
    * If you go in, Cleanse [Soul Rip](http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=69397) off Terenas Menethil, and heal him
  * [Vile Spirits](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=70498)
    * dive bomb into your raid and explode for massive amounts of damage
    * stay away from their targets and heal hard as they explode. Their targets will have aggro and so will show up in healing addons
    * Firstly we used a kiting path starting from 1 edge of the platform to the far edge of the platform. Secondly ranged are assigned to Vile Spirits to kill or lower their health. Finally, the tank that is not on Arthas is assigned to sit in the middle of the platform in-between the raid + Vile Spirits to intercept them as they come down. 
  * Cheat Sheet
    * Move Beacon/SS around as the tanks manage Soul Reaper
    * Heal hard and immediately when Harvest Soul goes up
    * Spread out for Defile and to minimize raiders hit by exploding spirits
    * Try to watch for raiders with spirit aggro and precast heals around them
    * Blow all cooldowns, there’s nothing left to save them for
    * Coordinate raid-wide survival cooldowns as spirits descend
    * Blow throughput and haste cooldowns if another healer is pulled in to Frostmourne
    * Heal Terenas, cleansing Soul Rip, if you get pulled into Frostmourne

### Phase 4
  * Don't release
