  * Don't [Cleanse](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=4987) the Abom tank!
  * [Beacon](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=53563) and Shield the main tank
  * /focus Putricide

  * /ttp main tank
  * Devo aura

### Phase 1
  * Start off all the way to the left in the corner.
  * Don't stand in the [Slime Puddle](http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=70341)s
  * Green ooze will cast [Volatile Ooze Adhesive](http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=70447) on someone.
    * [Sacred Shield](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=53601) + [Flash of Light](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=48785) the target
    * You can heal yourself if targeted
    * Optional: stack up on him to split the damage received if the slime makes it
  * After the green slime, move over to the right somewhat, be prepared to kite Orange ooze if targeted
  * Orange ooze will cast [Gaseous Bloat](http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=72832) DoT on someone
    * [Sacred Shield](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=53601) + [Flash of Light](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=48785) the target
    * Kite it around the boss if targeted

### Phase 2 (80%)
  * Same ooze stuff as Phase 1
  * Avoid [Malleable Goo](http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=72548) spots
  * Avoid orange bottles at Putricide's feet, running into them or damaging them causes [Choking Gas](http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=72619) and [Choking Gas Explosion](http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=72459), reducing hit %.


### Phase 3 (35%)
  * [Beacon](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=53563) one tank, heal the other
  * Stay ahead of the tanks so as not to get caught in growing slime
  * Tanks will get increasing stacks of [Mutated Plague](http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=72672), usu. switch after 3-4
  * Blow cooldowns: [Bubble](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=642/divine-shield) [Sac](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=64205), [Lay on Hands](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=48788)
