Wipes are generally from the following things:
  - the range tank not having enough purple balloons
  - the range tank not getting heals early on when there are not enough balloons to help mitigate damage
  - healers getting knocked over (either not moving themselves, or someone moving into them) and therefore tanks dying
  - kinetic bombs hitting the ground because the people allocated to stop them is not doing their job
  - People dying to the empowered vortices by not spreading out enough
  - Empowered fireballs not getting bled off enough

Pop bacon on the purple balloon tank
Go hard early, as that balloon tank will be taking a fair whack of damage
Stand as close to the centre as you can, and get people to move away from you.
Heal the other two tanks evenly
Use fire aura and pop AM when the big ball of fire is cast
Keep the current target in mind and keep judgment of light up on it as best you can.

Princes: Personally i beacon the orb tank because they move around a lot and staying within range
 can be a pain. Try to stay of the other 2 tanks while making sure you are not near shock vortexes. 
Fire aura helps and hitting aura mastery when empowered fire is going to hit helps a bit. If you 
have a non tank doing the orb boss try and divine sac during empowered and make sure beacon and
 judgement are refreshed outside this bosses empowered as you want to be able to spam heal the whole
 time. Also being in group with that tank helps for extra divine sac absorbs.  And if the "beach 
balls are getting close to the ground 40 yd judgement is nice to help with. Righteous fury is not 
something i would recomend. Almost all of your damage is avoidable and depending on the class of your 
ranged tank and how much they are chasing orbs around you can pull off of them.
