    Phase 1
    Get in melee range and get some mana back on your time with auto hits.
    Bacon the blood mirrored off tank and heal the main tank
    Make sure your raid frames show who has the bite buff, these guys dont need as much healing
    Shadow aura 
    
    Phase 2
    If you are human, get out of fear with your racial and bubble the second, otherwise bubble 
    off the first fear and tremor totem the second
    Get in position early and heal like crazy
    Use AM to cover off the fear to position transition and try to ensure people have extra resistance if they get a bad fear
