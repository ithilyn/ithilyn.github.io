## Saboteur Kip'tilak
* [Sabotage][]: cast on a random player, causing them to explode NESW after a few seconds.
* The strategy for this boss is all about positioning. Each party member must always position themselves in such a way that there are no bombs directly north, east, south, or west of them. This way, they will not get hit by trails of fire, and their [Sabotage][] explosions will not detonate additional bombs.
* At 70%/30%: detonates all the Stable Munitions with World in Flames
