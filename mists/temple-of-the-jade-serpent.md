## Wise Mari
Avoid all water, especially puddles dropped by elemental adds when they die. Move to the inner most circle and run ahead of the rotating water blast.

## Lorewalker Stonestep
DPS only one of either Strife or Peril until it has unhealable stacks (10?) of [Intensity](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=113315), then switch to the other. Blow cooldowns if stacks get too high. 

## Or, The Champion of the Five Suns
Kill suns, then tank/dps shas, heal/burn through Zao's random damage.

## Liu Flameheart
Tank in the middle. Avoid waves of flame and really, really don't stand in green circles on the floor. Dispel the [fire DoT](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=106823) ASAP.

## Sha of Doubt
Dispel [Touch of Nothingness](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=106113) ASAP. Stack and nuke adds with DPS cooldowns during purple phase, or after 40sec they explode and heal the boss.
